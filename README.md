# QuickToDoReminder
Just a todo reminder that stuffs I should code or do as soon as I have free time

---------

When you expose a game in a weekend event with several quest. 
The game need an option that reset the game to it initial state when the player is afk for too long.
ToDo: Recycle the afk code I did to make it more drag and drop able in a project.

--------

When you use 4-7 Quests, they need to stay in place. So you need color numbered spot that correspond to the color of the headset.
ToDo: Think and try to create an object to put on the ground to hold the quest and identify the color of the quest and the ground quickly from 10 meters from distance.

--------------------


Buy some "Xbox controller" like to connect to Quest 2 for small kids hand (6-12) for next Drone XR event.
